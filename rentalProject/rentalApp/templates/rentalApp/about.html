                        The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it 
                        on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled 
                        the text with their software. Today it's seen all around the web; on templates, websites, 
                        and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the authoritative
